The first draft for Talísk was created during my freshman year of college. It was never intended to be a full-fledged language, just a sketch of one. Yet here we are . . .

I imagine the Talísk people to be in the northeastern United States, at least in terms of climate and geography.

NOTE: The titles of each page will not include the accented i in the name of the language. This is for technical reasons.
