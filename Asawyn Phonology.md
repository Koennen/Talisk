This page outlines the phonology, phonotactics, and phonaesthetics* for Asawyn. Like all of my languages, I never start with phonology and consequently have a bad time trying to work backwards from the examples I've come up with. That's almost like doing real fieldwork!

\* The phonology avoids bilabial stops because they're bad.
# Vowels
Asawyn has 6 vowels (a shameless ripoff of [Na'vi vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%CA%BCvi_language#Vowels)):
* [/a/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_front_unrounded_vowel) - 'a'
* [/i/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_unrounded_vowel) - 'i'
* [/u/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_back_rounded_vowel) - 'u'
* [/e/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel) ~ [/ɛ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_front_unrounded_vowel) - 'e'
* [/o/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_back_rounded_vowel) - 'o'
* [/ɪ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_unrounded_vowel) - 'ì' / 'y'
# Consonants
Asawyn has 11 consonants, which is far fewer than I thought I had...
