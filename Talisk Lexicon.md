### Verbal Suffixes

#### Aspectual and Modal Suffixes

*These follow the tense suffix but are subordinate to it in terms of semantic
scope (i.e. the tense applies to the word last). Many may be stacked. They must
begin with a consonant and end with a vowel. None may have **h** as their sole
consonant.*  

*The following are explicitly forbidden:* **til, tak, ten, nil, nak, nen, fil,
fak, fen, nu, ku, ke, ne**

**-kla** - to do well  
**-nkla** - to do badly  
**-ksu** - to do carefully  
**-nksu** - to do carelessly  
**-fti** - to do slowly  
-**ki** - to do quickly  
**-le** - to do several times in succession  
**-si** - (of several people) to do individually at the same time, to 'each'
do  
**-nda** - (of several people) to do in succession, to take turns doing  
**-me** - imperative marker \[will always attach to the last verb in a chain of
commands]  
**-nku** - to do with/by force  
**-lna** - to finish doing (having succeeded)  
**-khe** - to finish doing (having failed)  
**-mfi** - to start doing  
**-da** - to want to do  
**-tu** - to attempt to do  
**-sa** - to do by accident  
**-lfi** - to do occasionally, "here and there"  

#### Converbal Suffixes

*These take the place of the tense suffix, and their first vowel is
consequently stressed. They are either single vowels, or two vowels separated
by **-h-**.*  

**-a** - combines verbs sequentially  

* **Naf-il dan neles akhand ildek-á-lna usil-í-me din-ak.**  
2-ERG\[SG] rock blue eight\[ABS] find-CVB-SUCC take-PRS-IMP 1-DAT\[SG]

2-ERG\[SG] PROX.DET-sand\[ABS.SG] grasp-CVB-CAREFUL form-PRS-SLOWLY-IMP
house-LOC  
"As you carefully hold the sand, slowly form it into houses."

* **Luk fend-íhi din-il lek-í.**  
3\[ABS.SG] greet-CVB 1-ERG\[SG] see-PRS  
"I saw her and she greeted \[me]."  

#### Noun-Deriving Suffixes

*These transform verbs into nouns. They can apply to any tensed verb with or
without suffixes. They are single consonants. If a verb stem begins with a
vowel, an **h-** is added to the beginning of the word.*  

**-k** - creates a subject noun (i.e. a noun denoting the agent of a transitive
verb or the sole argument of an intransitive verb)  

* **Husil-é-nku-lfi-k-il dadan suld-ínu.**  
take-AOR-FORCE-OCC-SUBJ-ERG\[SG] blood\[ABS.SG] drink-DIST.PST  
"A thief drank blood."  

* **Li-kel-é-k mus-í.**
DIST.DET-run-AOR-SUBJ\[ABS.SG] sweat-PRS  
"That runner is sweating."

transitive verb)
