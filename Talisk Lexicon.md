### Verbal Suffixes

#### Aspectual and Modal Suffixes

*These follow the tense suffix but are subordinate to it in terms of semantic
scope (i.e. the tense applies to the word last). Many may be stacked. They must
begin with a consonant and end with a vowel. None may have **h** as their sole
consonant.*  

*The following are explicitly forbidden:* **til**, **tak**, **ten**, **nil**,
**nak**, **nen**, **fil**, **fak**, **fen**, **nu**, **ku**, **ke**, **ne**

**-kla** - to do well  
**-nkla** - to do badly  
**-ksu** - to do carefully  
**-nksu** - to do carelessly  
**-fti** - to do slowly  
-**ki** - to do quickly  
**-le** - to do several times in succession  
**-si** - (of several people) to do individually at the same time, to 'each'
do  
**-nda** - (of several people) to do in succession, to take turns doing  
**-me** - imperative marker \[will always attach to the last verb in a chain of
commands]  
**-nku** - to do with/by force  
**-lna** - to finish doing (having succeeded)

{PL-side GEN-PROX.DET-tree}-LOC  
"In the park, they ran (lit. walked quickly) around (lit. at the sides of)
this tree."  

#### Adjective-Deriving Suffix

*This suffix takes the place of the tense suffix and is consequently stressed.
The derived meaning is not always obvious but typically refers to some
resultant state or characteristic of the experiencer of the verb. As such, this
suffix attaches primarily to intransitive verbs.*  

**-u** - produces a proto-adjective (to be followed by the empty adjective)  

* **Ha-díkt ta-lúk mus-ú eln-il duken na-meld-ínu-de.**  
PL-hand GEN-3 sweat-ADJ {}-ERG rope NEG-grip-DIST.PST-can  
"His sweaty hands could not grip the rope."  

#### Converbal Suffixes

*These take the place of the tense suffix, and their first vowel is
consequently stressed. They are either single vowels, or two vowels separated
by **-h-**.*  

**-a** - combines verbs sequentially  

* **Naf-il dan neles akhand ildek-á-lna usil-í-me din-ak.**  
2-ERG\[SG] rock blue eight\[ABS] find-CVB-SUCC take-PRS-IMP 1-DAT\[SG]  
"Fetch (lit. seek and pick up for) me eight blue rocks."

3\[ABS.SG] greet-CVB 1-ERG\[SG] see-DIST.PST  
"I saw her and she greeted \[me]."  

#### Tensed Noun-Deriving Suffixes

*These transform verbs into nouns. They can apply to any tensed verb with or
without suffixes. They are single consonants. If a verb stem begins with a
vowel, an **h-** is added to the beginning of the word.*  

**-k** - creates an animate subject noun (i.e. a noun denoting the agent of a
transitive verb or the sole argument of an intransitive verb)

take-AOR-FORCE-OCC-SUBJ-ERG\[SG] blood\[ABS.SG] drink-DIST.PST

DIST.DET-walk-AOR-QUICKLY-SUBJ\[ABS.SG] sweat-PRS  
"That runner (lit. one who walks quickly) is sweating."

**-s** - creates an *inanimate* subject noun. This can also be used as an
instrumental marker  

* **Naf-il le-hul-é-s dus-í-me din-at.**  
2-ERG\[SG] PROX.DET-burn-AOR-SUBJ\[ABS.SG] give-PRS-IMP 1-DAT\[SG]  
"Hand me the lighter (lit. burner)."

**-n** - creates an object noun (i.e. a noun denoting the patient of a
transitive verb)  

* **Naf ihak-il le-dus-íke-n iksal kifl-í-me!**  
2 four-ERG PROX.DET-give-PROX.FUT-OBJ seven\[ABS] cover-PRS-IMP  
"You four! Hide (lit. 'cover') these seven gifts (lit. 'soon-to-be-given
things')!  

**-f** - creates a recipient noun  

* **Hidus-é-f enk-í-mfi.**  
present-AOR-RECIP\[ABS.SG] sit-PRS-INIT  
"An audience member (lit. 'one who is presented to') is sitting down (lit.
'beginning to be seated')."  

#### Un-Tensed Noun-Deriving Suffixes

**-hem** - creates a location where the action of the verb is characteristically
performed

## Adverbs and Frames

Before the verb, these words act as "frames" that situate the sentence in time
and/or space. After the verb, these represent destinations (if applicable). This
distinction is akin to that made in these sentences in German:  

* **Ich gehe im Haus.**  
I walk in the house.  

* **Ich gehe ins Haus.**  
I walk into the house.  

Any noun in the locative case also functions in this manner.  

**sem** - here  
**sul\'{e}m** - *hypothetical frame*: if so  

## Particles and Interjections

**alka** - used to express agreement with the last thing said  
**e** - copular particle

Used as a request to enter someone's house. It is more polite than just asking

Used in informal contexts when two or more people are greeting another party.
