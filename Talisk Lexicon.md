### Verbal Suffixes

#### Aspectual and Modal Suffixes

*These follow the tense suffix but are subordinate to it in terms of semantic
scope (i.e. the tense applies to the word last). Many may be stacked. They must
begin with a consonant and end with a vowel. None may have **h** as their sole
consonant.*  

*The following are explicitly forbidden:* **til**, **tak**, **ten**, **nil**,
**nak**, **nen**, **fil**, **fak**, **fen**, **nu**, **ku**, **ke**, **ne**

**-kla** - to do well  
**-nkla** - to do badly  
**-ksu** - to do carefully  
**-nksu** - to do carelessly  
**-fti** - to do slowly  
-**ki** - to do quickly  
**-le** - to do several times in succession  
**-si** - (of several people) to do individually at the same time, to 'each'
do  
**-nda** - (of several people) to do in succession, to take turns doing  
**-me** - imperative marker \[will always attach to the last verb in a chain of
commands]

PL-3\[ABS] walk-DIST.PST-QUICKLY {PL-side GEN-PROX.DET-tree}-LOC  
"They ran (lit. walked quickly) around (lit. at the sides of) this tree."  

#### Adjective-Deriving Suffix

*This suffix takes the place of the tense suffix and is consequently stressed.
The derived meaning is not always obvious but typically refers to some
resultant state or characteristic of the experiencer of the verb. As such, this
suffix attaches primarily to intransitive verbs.*  

**-u** - produces a proto-adjective (to be followed by the empty adjective)  

* **Ha-díkt ta-lúk mus-ú eln-il duken na-meld-ínu-de.**  
PL-hand GEN-3 sweat-ADJ {}-ERG rope NEG-grip-DIST.PST-can  
"His sweaty hands could not grip the rope."  

#### Converbal Suffixes

*These take the place of the tense suffix, and their first vowel is
consequently stressed. They are either single vowels, or two vowels separated
by **-h-**.*  

**-a** - combines verbs sequentially  

* **Naf-il dan neles akhand ildek-á-lna usil-í-me din-ak.**  
2-ERG\[SG] rock blue eight\[ABS] find-CVB-SUCC take-PRS-IMP 1-DAT\[SG]  
"Fetch (lit. seek and pick up for) me eight blue rocks."  

* **Luk fend-á din-il lek-ínu.**  
3\[ABS.SG] greet-CVB 1-ERG\[SG] see-DIST.PST

**-uha** - combines verbs simultaneously

* **Naf-il le-núlus meld-úha-ksu al-í-fti-me ha-sálf-em.**  
2-ERG\[SG] PROX.DET-sand\[ABS.SG] grasp-CVB-CAREFUL form-PRS-SLOWLY-IMP
small bird-LOC  
"As you carefully hold the sand, slowly form it into birds."  

**-ihi** - combines verbs in reverse chronological order  

* **Luk fend-íhi din-il lek-ínu.**  
3\[ABS.SG] greet-CVB 1-ERG\[SG] see-DIST.PST  
"I saw her and she greeted \[me]."  

#### Noun-Deriving Suffixes

*These transform verbs into nouns. They can apply to any tensed verb with or
without suffixes. They are single consonants. If a verb stem begins with a
vowel, an **h-** is added to the beginning of the word.*  

**-k** - creates an animate subject noun (i.e. a noun denoting the agent of a transitive
verb or the sole argument of an intransitive verb)

take-AOR-FORCE-OCC-SUBJ-ERG\[SG] blood\[ABS.SG] drink-DIST.PST

DIST.DET-walk-AOR-QUICKLY-SUBJ\[ABS.SG] sweat-PRS  
"That runner (lit. one who walks quickly) is sweating."

**-s** - creates an *inanimate* subject noun. This can also be used as an instrumental
marker  

* **Naf-il le-hul-é-s dus-í-me din-at.**

"Hand me the lighter (lit. burner)."

**-n** - creates an object noun (i.e. a noun denoting the patient of a
transitive verb)  

* **Naf ihak-il le-dus-íke-n iksal kifl-í-me!**  
2 four-ERG PROX.DET-give-PROX.FUT-OBJ seven\[ABS] cover-PRS-IMP  
"You four! Hide (lit. 'cover') these seven gifts (lit. 'soon-to-be-given
things')!

"An audience member (lit. 'one who is presented to') is sitting down (lit.
