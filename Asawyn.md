After reading R.M.W. Dixon's [*Ergativity*](https://www.cambridge.org/mc/universitypress/subjects/languages-linguistics/grammar-and-syntax/ergativity), I felt inspired to create a language with an ergative-absolutive alignment, particularly one exploring split-ergativity. I also wanted to throw in some other features I found cool, like verb-final syntax. I'm not really for sure which culture would speak Asawyn, but anthropology was never really all that interesting on its own...
